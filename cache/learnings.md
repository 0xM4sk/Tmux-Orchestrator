# Consolidated Learnings

This file consolidates lessons learned from both failure and success scenarios in the Tmux Orchestrator project.

## Principles

1. **Failure-First Documentation**: Record failure scenarios before success patterns
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes, not just symptoms
3. **Actionable Solutions**: Provide specific steps to prevent recurrence
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes across scenarios
5. **Regular Review**: Monthly assessment of lessons for continued relevance

## Structure

- **Failure Scenarios**: Documented with context, root cause, impact, and solution
- **Success Patterns**: Documented reusable approaches that consistently work
- **Lessons Learned**: Consolidated insights with priority rankings
- **Action Items**: Specific steps to implement learnings

## Contributing

When adding to this file:
1. Start with a failure scenario if applicable
2. Include sufficient context for understanding
3. Focus on root causes rather than symptoms
4. Provide actionable solutions
5. Cross-reference related entries
6. Update the "Last Review Date" field
