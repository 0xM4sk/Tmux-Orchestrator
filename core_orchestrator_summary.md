# Core Orchestrator System Summary

## Overview
The Core Orchestrator System is a modular framework for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents in a tmux-based environment. It provides a robust architecture for agent lifecycle management, communication, execution tracking, and monitoring.

## Core Modules

### 1. Agent Management
Manages agent lifecycle, creation, and registration.

#### Components:
- **agent_factory.py**: Factory pattern implementation for creating agents
  - `Agent` (abstract base class)
  - `BaseAgent` (basic implementation)
  - `AgentFactory` (factory for creating agents)

- **agent_registry.py**: Central registry for managing agents in the system
  - `AgentRegistry` (maintains registry of all agents)
  - Integrates with `AgentStateManager` for agent state management

- **agent_state_manager.py**: Manages agent states and lifecycle
  - `AgentState` (enum defining agent states)
  - `AgentStateManager` (manages state transitions)

#### Relationships:
```
AgentFactory <- creates -> Agent instances
AgentRegistry <- manages -> Agent instances
AgentRegistry <- uses -> AgentStateManager
```

### 2. Communication System
Handles message routing and conversation management between agents.

#### Components:
- **message_router.py**: Routes messages between agents and services
  - `MessageRouter` (routes messages based on type)
  - Supports specific and default routes

- **protocol_enforcer.py**: Ensures message format and protocol compliance
  - `ProtocolEnforcer` (validates message formats)
  - `MessageValidator` (validates message content)

- **conversation_manager.py**: Manages multi-agent conversations
  - `ConversationState` (enum defining conversation states)
  - `Message` (dataclass for conversation messages)
  - `Conversation` (dataclass for conversation context)
  - `ConversationManager` (manages conversations)

#### Relationships:
```
MessageRouter <- routes -> Messages
ProtocolEnforcer <- validates -> Messages
ConversationManager <- manages -> Conversations
Conversation <- contains -> Messages
```

### 3. Execution Tracking
Monitors agent task execution and handles recovery from failures.

#### Components:
- **execution_monitor.py**: Monitors agent task execution
  - `ExecutionMonitor` (tracks task execution)
  - `TaskExecution` (dataclass for execution tracking)

- **gap_detector.py**: Detects execution gaps and inconsistencies
  - `GapDetector` (identifies execution gaps)
  - `ExecutionGap` (dataclass for gap tracking)

- **recovery_manager.py**: Manages recovery from execution failures
  - `RecoveryManager` (handles execution recovery)
  - `RecoveryStrategy` (abstract base class for recovery strategies)

#### Relationships:
```
ExecutionMonitor <- tracks -> TaskExecution
GapDetector <- analyzes -> TaskExecution
RecoveryManager <- uses -> GapDetector
RecoveryManager <- applies -> RecoveryStrategy
```

### 4. Dashboard Monitoring
Provides system metrics and alerting for system monitoring.

#### Components:
- **dashboard_manager.py**: Manages system dashboards and layouts
  - `DashboardManager` (manages dashboard configurations)
  - `DashboardLayout` (dataclass for layout definitions)

- **metrics_collector.py**: Collects system metrics for visualization
  - `MetricsCollector` (collects system metrics)
  - `SystemMetrics` (dataclass for metric data)

- **alert_system.py**: Handles system alerts and notifications
  - `AlertSystem` (manages system alerts)
  - `Alert` (dataclass for alert information)
  - `AlertLevel` (enum for alert severity)

#### Relationships:
```
DashboardManager <- displays -> SystemMetrics
MetricsCollector <- provides -> SystemMetrics
AlertSystem <- monitors -> SystemMetrics
AlertSystem <- generates -> Alerts
```

### 5. Data Management
Handles data storage, processing, and validation.

#### Components:
- **data_store.py**: Persistent storage for system data
  - `DataStore` (manages data persistence)
  - `DataRecord` (dataclass for stored records)

- **data_processor.py**: Processes and transforms data
  - `DataProcessor` (processes data transformations)
  - `DataTransformation` (abstract base class for transformations)

- **data_validator.py**: Validates data integrity and format
  - `DataValidator` (validates data integrity)
  - `ValidationRule` (abstract base class for validation rules)

#### Relationships:
```
DataStore <- stores -> DataRecord
DataProcessor <- transforms -> DataRecord
DataValidator <- validates -> DataRecord
```

### 6. Services
Provides cross-cutting services for the system.

#### Components:
- **authentication/**: Handles user authentication and session management
  - `auth_manager.py`: User authentication and session management
    - `AuthStatus` (enum for authentication statuses)
    - `AuthSession` (dataclass for session information)
    - `AuthManager` (manages authentication processes)
  
  - `token_manager.py`: Manages authentication tokens
    - `Token` (dataclass for token information)
    - `TokenManager` (manages authentication tokens)
  
  - `user_manager.py`: Manages user accounts and profiles
    - `User` (dataclass for user information)
    - `UserManager` (manages user accounts)

#### Relationships:
```
AuthManager <- creates -> AuthSession
TokenManager <- creates -> Token
UserManager <- manages -> User
AuthManager <- uses -> TokenManager
```

## System Integration

### Data Flow
1. Agents are created by `AgentFactory` and registered in `AgentRegistry`
2. Agents communicate through `MessageRouter` with protocol validation by `ProtocolEnforcer`
3. Multi-agent conversations are managed by `ConversationManager`
4. Task execution is monitored by `ExecutionMonitor` with gap detection by `GapDetector`
5. System metrics are collected by `MetricsCollector` and displayed by `DashboardManager`
6. Alerts are generated by `AlertSystem` based on metric thresholds
7. Data is stored, processed, and validated through the Data Management modules
8. Authentication is handled by the Authentication Service modules

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern**: Used in `AgentFactory` for creating agents
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Used in manager classes for system-wide coordination
3. **Observer Pattern**: Used in alerting and monitoring systems
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Used in recovery strategies and data transformations
5. **Dataclasses**: Used extensively for data modeling

## Extensibility Points
1. New agent types can be registered with `AgentFactory`
2. New message routes can be added to `MessageRouter`
3. New recovery strategies can be implemented from `RecoveryStrategy`
4. New data transformations can be implemented from `DataTransformation`
5. New validation rules can be implemented from `ValidationRule`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- tmux
- Standard Python libraries (typing, logging, threading, dataclasses, enum, datetime)
- Third-party libraries (jwt for token management)
