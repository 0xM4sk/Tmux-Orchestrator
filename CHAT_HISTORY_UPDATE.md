# Chat History Display Enhancement

## Overview

The `display_chat_history.py` script has been updated to show the actual agent identities in the chat log display, as requested. The previous generic labels of "User" and "Headless" have been replaced with specific agent identifiers.

## Updated Display Format

The chat history now shows the following identities:

1. **Developers**: Displayed as "👨‍💻 Dev-X" where X is the developer number
   - Example: "developer_project-strangers-calendar-app_2" now shows as "👨‍💻 Dev-2"

2. **Project Managers**: Displayed as "👑 User (PM)"
   - Example: "project_manager_project-strangers-calendar-app" shows as "👑 User (PM)"

3. **System Prompts**: Displayed as "⚙️ Sys Prompt"
   - For messages with sender role as "system"

4. **Regular Users**: Displayed as "👤 User"
   - For messages with sender role as "user"

## Implementation Details

The `format_message_for_display` function in `display_chat_history.py` was updated to:

1. Extract developer numbers from agent IDs when available
2. Show specific labels for project managers
3. Distinguish between system prompts and regular users
4. Maintain clear visual indicators for each role

## Example Output

```
[15:52:42] 👨‍💻 Dev-2:
    It appears that the issue with running the end-to-end tests is still present...

[15:53:27] 👤 User:
    Continue working on the current project...

[15:54:11] 🤖 Headless:
    I'll start by correcting the JSON syntax in the `package.json` file...
```

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Communication**: Users can immediately identify which specific developer is communicating
2. **Better Context**: Project managers are clearly labeled for better role identification
3. **Improved Readability**: System prompts are distinguished from user messages
4. **Consistent Formatting**: All agent identities follow a consistent visual pattern

This enhancement provides a much clearer view of the actual communication happening between agents in the system.
