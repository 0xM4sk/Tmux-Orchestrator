# Authentication Module Templates

This directory contains template boilerplate code for authentication functionality that can be refined over time.

## Purpose

These templates serve as cached code to reduce inference time and resource cycles during development. They provide starting points for implementing authentication in projects while maintaining consistency across implementations.

## Contents

- Template implementations for common authentication patterns
- Boilerplate code for various authentication providers
- Configuration examples and best practices
- Integration patterns with the core orchestrator system

## Usage

When implementing authentication in a project:
1. Copy the relevant templates to your project
2. Customize for your specific requirements
3. Refine and optimize based on your use case
4. Contribute improvements back to the templates

## Contributing

Add new authentication patterns and update existing templates as better approaches are discovered.
