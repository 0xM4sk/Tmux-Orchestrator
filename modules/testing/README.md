# Testing Module Templates

This directory contains template boilerplate code for testing functionality that can be refined over time.

## Purpose

These templates serve as cached code to reduce inference time and resource cycles during development. They provide starting points for implementing comprehensive testing strategies while maintaining consistency across implementations.

## Contents

- Template implementations for unit testing patterns
- Boilerplate code for integration testing
- Configuration examples for test frameworks
- Best practices for test organization and execution
- Integration patterns with the core orchestrator system

## Usage

When implementing testing in a project:
1. Copy the relevant templates to your project
2. Customize for your specific requirements
3. Refine and optimize based on your use case
4. Contribute improvements back to the templates

## Contributing

Add new testing patterns and update existing templates as better approaches are discovered.
