# API Module Templates

This directory contains template boilerplate code for API functionality that can be refined over time.

## Purpose

These templates serve as cached code to reduce inference time and resource cycles during development. They provide starting points for implementing API endpoints and services while maintaining consistency across implementations.

## Contents

- Template implementations for REST API patterns
- Boilerplate code for GraphQL APIs
- Configuration examples for API frameworks
- Best practices for API design and documentation
- Integration patterns with the core orchestrator system

## Usage

When implementing APIs in a project:
1. Copy the relevant templates to your project
2. Customize for your specific requirements
3. Refine and optimize based on your use case
4. Contribute improvements back to the templates

## Contributing

Add new API patterns and update existing templates as better approaches are discovered.
