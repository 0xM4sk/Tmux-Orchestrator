# AWS Module Templates

This directory contains template boilerplate code for AWS integration functionality that can be refined over time.

## Purpose

These templates serve as cached code to reduce inference time and resource cycles during development. They provide starting points for implementing AWS services and integrations while maintaining consistency across implementations.

## Contents

- Template implementations for common AWS service integrations
- Boilerplate code for AWS SDK usage patterns
- Configuration examples for AWS services
- Best practices for AWS deployment and management
- Integration patterns with the core orchestrator system

## Usage

When implementing AWS integrations in a project:
1. Copy the relevant templates to your project
2. Customize for your specific requirements
3. Refine and optimize based on your use case
4. Contribute improvements back to the templates

## Contributing

Add new AWS integration patterns and update existing templates as better approaches are discovered.
