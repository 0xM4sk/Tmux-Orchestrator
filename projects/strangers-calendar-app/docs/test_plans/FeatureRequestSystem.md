# Test Plan for Feature Request System

## Overview
The feature request system allows users to submit, review, and track their feature requests within the app. This test plan ensures that all functionalities are thoroughly tested.

## Requirements
- Users should be able to submit a new feature request.
- Requests should be reviewed by administrators before approval.
- Approved requests should be implemented and integrated into the system.

## Test Cases

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the "Feature Requests" tab.
2. Click on "Submit Request".
3. Fill out the request form with valid details (e.g., title, description).
4. Submit the request.

**Expected Result**:
- A confirmation message is displayed indicating that the request has been submitted successfully.
- The request appears in the list of pending requests for administrators to review.

### TC2: Review and Approve a Feature Request

- A notification is sent to the user indicating that their request has been denied with the provided reason.

## Automation
- Automated tests will be created for submitting and reviewing feature requests using Selenium or similar tools.
- Manual testing will also be conducted to ensure edge cases are covered.

## Documentation
- Detailed documentation on how to use the feature request system will be updated in the app's help section.
