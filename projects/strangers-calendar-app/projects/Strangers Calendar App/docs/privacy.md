# Privacy Requirements for OAuth Authentication

## Overview
The OAuth authentication endpoints should comply with data protection regulations and ensure user privacy.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data transmitted between the client and server must be encrypted using TLS.
- **Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized users can access the OAuth endpoints.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit logs to track all access attempts and actions on the OAuth endpoints.
- **User Consent**: Users must provide explicit consent before their personal data is shared with third-party services.

## Testing
- Test the encryption of data transmitted between the client and server.
- Verify that access controls are properly implemented.
- Ensure audit logs capture all necessary information.
- Test the user consent mechanism to ensure it complies with privacy regulations.
