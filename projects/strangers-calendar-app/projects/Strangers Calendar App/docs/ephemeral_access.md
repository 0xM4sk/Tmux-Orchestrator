# Ephemeral Access Requirements for OAuth Authentication

## Overview
Ephemeral access should be implemented to ensure that user sessions are short-lived and do not compromise privacy.

## Implementation Details
- **Session Expiry**: Set a maximum session duration of 15 minutes.
- **Token Revocation**: Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if the user logs out or the account is disabled.
- **Secure Token Storage**: Store tokens securely using a secure token store (e.g., JWT with RSA encryption).
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the OAuth endpoints.

## Testing
- Test session expiry after 15 minutes of inactivity.
- Verify that tokens are revoked when the user logs out or the account is disabled.
- Ensure secure storage and retrieval of tokens.
- Test rate limiting to ensure it prevents brute-force attacks.
