# Tmux Orchestrator Architecture Summary

This document provides an overview of the proposed architecture for the Tmux Orchestrator system, with clear separation between core functionality and demo applications.

## Core System

The core orchestrator system contains only essential functionality for agent management and orchestration:

- **agent_management/**: Agent lifecycle, creation, and registration
- **communication_system/**: Message routing and conversation handling
- **dashboard_monitoring/**: System metrics and alerting
- **data_management/**: Data storage, processing, and validation
- **execution_tracking/**: Task monitoring and recovery

The core system is designed to be minimal and focused, without unnecessary dependencies on authentication or notification services.

## Modules

Template boilerplate code that can be used across projects:

- **authentication/**: Auth templates and boilerplate
- **notification/**: Notification templates and boilerplate
- **testing/**: Testing templates and boilerplate
- **api/**: API templates and boilerplate
- **aws/**: AWS integration templates and boilerplate

These modules serve as cached code to reduce inference time and resource cycles during development.

## Demos

Demo applications are completely separated from the core system:

- **strangers-calendar-app/**: Complete calendar application demo with its own services

Each demo contains all necessary components within its own directory structure.

## Users

User-generated content and documentation:

- **diagrams/**: Visual documentation
- **examples/**: Usage patterns and templates
- **rulesets/**: Explicit rules and guidelines
- **formatting_guide.md**: Standards for content creation

## Cache

Consolidated knowledge and lessons learned:

- **failures/**: Documented failure scenarios and solutions
- **successes/**: Documented success patterns
- **lessons/**: Consolidated lessons learned
- **learnings.md**: Main learnings consolidation

The cache follows a failure-first approach to documentation, prioritizing lessons learned from problems over successes.

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Core system is completely isolated from demos and templates
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Core system only includes essential functionality
3. **Reusable Templates**: Common patterns are cached for efficient reuse
4. **Knowledge Management**: Systematic approach to learning from experience
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new demos, modules, and user content
6. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make maintenance easier
